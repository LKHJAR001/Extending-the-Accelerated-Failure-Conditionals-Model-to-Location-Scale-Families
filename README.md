Abstract:

\citet{arnold2020bivariate} introduced a novel class of bivariate conditionally specified distributions, in which dependence between two random variables is established by defining the distribution of one variable conditional on the other. This conditioning regime was formulated through survival functions and termed the accelerated failure conditional model. Subsequently, \citet{Lakhani2025accelerated} extended this conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, thereby moving beyond families with strictly monotonically decaying marginals. The present study builds on this line of work by proposing a conditional survival specification derived from a location-scale distributional family, where the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ arises not only through the acceleration function but also via a location function. An illustrative example of this new specification is developed using a Weibull marginal. The resulting models are fully characterized by closed-form expressions for their moments, and simulations are implemented using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally, the model is applied to an dataset in which the empirical distribution of $Y$ lies on the real line, demonstrating the model’s capacity to accommodate $Y$ marginals defined over $\mathbb{R}$.
